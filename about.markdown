I'm just a boy, standing in front of the AWS console, asking him why one microservice can't reach the other even though all the security groups are clearly configured correctly.

This is a place for me to share what I have learned, my thoughts and my doubts about software and cloud architecture (so many doubts...).

If I could resume my world view in a phrase it would be "Developing in the cloud should be easier."
